# Gradle Kotlin DSL Demo

This project shows how to use `kotlin DSL` for `gradle` to generate Java & Kotlin jars.

You can find solutions for:

* copy resources to build path from project's resource dir.
* copy all dependencies to build path for `thin` jar.
* make different file name for `thin` jar and `fat` jar.
* zip all dependencies into `fat` jar.
* use `TestNG` for unit test.

 Only official plugins are required.
